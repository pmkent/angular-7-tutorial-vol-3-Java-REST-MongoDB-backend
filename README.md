Angular 7 Tutorial - Vol. 3 - Java REST MongoDB Backend User Database - Angular, Java, MongoDB

In this (the 3rd of our Angular 7 tutorials we are going to install a Java, MongoDB user database with three users.

We'll examine how to create the user Java application from scratch, import the project into the IntelliJ IDEA tool.

We will be using Apache Maven project builder, IntelliJ IDEA IDE, Robo 3T MongoDB viewer tool among other tools.

The user project will be built using Java 8 and the latest version of Angular 7.

At the end of the tutorial I'll show you how to populate the user MongoDB using a java class UserDB we'll be using to populate 3 users.

We will also examine how to create Swagger UI REST Html documents to test the REST backend if you need to debug the backend without the Angular front-end.
